# Racecar

This is simple game where a race car can go around a track. This project is still in progress as I am working on adding a deep learning model to train the car
to drive around the track itself. This project is very raw because of that as it was just supposed to be a base to implement some kind of AI.

Movement of the car is through the movement keys and if the car gets too far off the track, the game will end.
